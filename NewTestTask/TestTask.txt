Earth is the third planet from the Sun and the only object 
in the Universe known to harbor life. According to radiometric dating 
and other sources of evidence, Earth formed over 4 billion years ago. 
Earth's gravity interacts with other objects in space, especially 
the Sun and the Moon, Earth's only natural satellite. Earth's axis of rotation 
is tilted, producing seasonal variations on the planet's surface.
